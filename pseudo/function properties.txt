    Domain: The set of input values for which the function is defined.

    Range: The set of output values that the function can produce.

    Continuity: The property of being "smooth" or having no abrupt changes in value.

    Differentiability: The property of having a well-defined derivative at every point in the domain.

    Monotonicity: The property of either increasing or decreasing throughout its domain.

    Symmetry: The property of being unchanged when certain transformations are applied, such as reflection or rotation.

    Periodicity: The property of repeating itself at regular intervals.

    Asymptotes: The behavior of the function as the input approaches certain values or infinity.

    Convexity/Concavity: The shape of the graph of the function, whether it is curved upward or downward.

    Invertibility: The property of having an inverse function that maps the output values back to their corresponding input values.
